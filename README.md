# Discord Chrome App

*Note: To view the Canary and PTB versions head to their branch.*

## Introduction 

I wanted a good way to have Discord on my Chromebook, but most of the existing Chrome apps didn't have the mic and camera working. So I made this. After testing, camera and mic work fine. This will also work on Windows and Mac. I haven't tested Linux.

## Installation

Head over to the 'Releases' tab, and grab the crx file you want. PTB and Canary correspond to the Discord PTB and Canary releases. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and turn on Developer mode with the toggle in the top-right corner. Open the Files app (or the equivelant on your platform of choice), and drag the .crx into the Extensions Chrome tab. Select add app in the window that comes up, and now you can turn off developer mode. 

That's it! You're done.
